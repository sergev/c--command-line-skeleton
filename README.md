Here is an example of a command line C++ application.

Anytime you want to start a new command line tool in C++, feel free to use this code as a skeleton.
Copy the contents to your repository and build your code upon it.

Command line parameters are parsed using getopt_long() routine.

To build, use cmake:

    cd cxx-command-line-skeleton
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
